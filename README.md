# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The client was The Gaming Room. They wanted a web-based adaptation of their Android game "Draw It or Lose It" that can be played across various platforms.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**


When I developed this documentation, I believe I really excelled in its structure and organization. Each section clearly defines its objectives and content, providing a systematic approach to the design. The thorough evaluation of different operating platforms and their respective characteristics provides clarity for future development. The recommendations section also offered specific and actionable advice on various aspects of system architecture, from memory management to security, giving clear directives for implementing the project.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

When working through the design document, what I found immensely helpful in the coding process was examining the domain model through a UML class diagram. It provided a clearer understanding of how various components within the application were interconnected. By visualizing these relationships, it became easier to develop concise classes and methods that leveraged the unique attributes of other components, resulting in a unified and efficient model.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**


If I had to revisit a portion of the documentation, I'd focus on refining the "Development Requirements" section. The current breakdown, while comprehensive, can be streamlined for clarity. By consolidating common elements and utilizing visual aids like tables, I could enhance readability and ease of reference.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

The document discusses the significance of cross-platform compatibility and efficient memory management for the game. By addressing these aspects and other user needs, the game could provide a consistent and uninterrupted gaming experience regardless of the device or platform used. Prioritizing user requirements during the design phase leads to a more intuitive and user-friendly product and creates trust and satisfaction among the target audience. Understanding and catering to user needs are vital to succeed in software design.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

I tackled the software design using an object-oriented approach, backed by a structured design template. The combination proved effective for this project.  For future projects, I'd maintain this object-oriented approach, but I would also consider incorporating user feedback earlier in the design process and using rapid prototyping techniques to quickly validate design choices, ensuring that the end product aligns closely with user needs and expectations.
